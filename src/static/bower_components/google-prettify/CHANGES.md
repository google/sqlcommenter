# Known Issues

 * Perl formatting is really crappy. Partly because the author is lazy and partly
   because Perl is [hard](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=663393) to parse.
 * On some browsers, `<code>` elements with newlines in the text which use CSS
   to specify `white-space:pre` will have the newlines improperly stripped if
   the element is not attached to the document at the time the stripping is done.
   Also, on IE6, all newlines will be stripped from `<code>` elements because
   of the way IE6 produces `innerHTML`. Workaround: use `<pre>` for code with
   newlines.

# Change Log

## 29 March 2007

 * Added [tests](https://rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/tests/prettify_test.html#PHP)
   for PHP support to address issue [#3](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/3).
 * Fixed bug [#6](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/6): `prettyPrintOne`
   was not halting. This was not reachable through the normal entry point.
 * Fixed bug [#4](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/4): recursing into a
   script block or PHP tag that was not properly closed would not silently drop the content.
   ([test](https://rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/tests/prettify_test.html#issue4))
 * Fixed bug [#8](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/8): was eating tabs
   ([test](https://rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/tests/prettify_test.html#issue8))
 * Fixed entity handling so that the caveat

   > Caveats: please properly escape less-thans. `x&lt;y` instead of `x<y`,
   > and use `"` instead of `&quot;` for string delimiters.

   is no longer applicable.
 * Added *noisefree*'s C# patch [#7](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/7)
 * Added a [distribution](http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/files/prettify-small.zip)
   that has comments and whitespace removed to reduce download size from 45.5kB
   to 12.8kB.

## 4 Jul 2008

 * Added [#17](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/17) language specific
   formatters that are triggered by the presence of a `lang-<language-file-extension>`
 * Fixed bug [#29](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/29): python
   handling of `'''string'''`
 * Fixed bug: `/` in regex `[charsets] should not end regex`

## 5 Jul 2008

 * Defined language extensions for Lisp and Lua

## 14 Jul 2008

 * Language handlers for F#, OCAML, SQL
 * Support for `nocode` spans to allow embedding of line numbers and code
   annotations which should not be styled or otherwise affect the tokenization
   of prettified code. See the issue [#22](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/22)
   [testcase](https://rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/tests/prettify_test.html#issue22).

## 6 Jan 2009

 * Language handlers for Visual Basic, Haskell, CSS, and WikiText
 * Added `.mxml` extension to the markup style handler for
   Flex [MXML files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MXML).
   See issue [#37](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/37).
 * Added `.m` extension to the C style handler so that Objective C source files
   properly highlight. See issue [#58](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/58).
 * Changed HTML lexer to use the same embedded source mechanism as the wiki
   language handler, and changed to use the registered CSS handler for STYLE
   element content.

## 21 May 2009

 * Rewrote to improve performance on large files.
   See [benchmarks](http://mikesamuel.blogspot.com/2009/05/efficient-parsing-in-javascript.html).
 * Fixed bugs with highlighting of Haskell line comments, Lisp number literals,
   Lua strings, C preprocessor directives, newlines in Wiki code on Windows, and
   newlines in IE6.

## 14 August 2009

 * Fixed prettifying of `<code>` blocks with embedded newlines.

## 3 October 2009

 * Fixed prettifying of XML/HTML tags that contain uppercase letters.

## 19 July 2010

 * Added support for line numbers. Bug [#22](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/22)
 * Added YAML support. Bug [#123](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/123)
 * Added VHDL support courtesy *Le Poussin*.
 * IE performance improvements. Bug [#102](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/102)
   courtesy *jacobly*.
 * A variety of markup formatting fixes courtesy *smain* and *thezbyg*.
 * Fixed copy and paste in IE 6, 7, 8.
 * Changed output to use `&#160;` instead of `&nbsp;` so that the output works
   when embedded in XML. Bug [#108](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/issues/108).

## 7 September 2010

 * Added support for coffeescript courtesy *Cezary Bartoszuk*.

## 4 March 2011

 * Added a [themes gallery](https://rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/styles/index.html)
   to showcase contributed styles.
 * Added support for XQuery courtesy *Patrick Wied*, Nemerle courtesy *Zimin A.V.*,
   and Latex support courtesy *Martin S*.

## 29 March 2011

 * Fixed IE newline issues, and copying/pasting of prettified source code from IE.
   This required significant internal changes but involves no API changes.
   **Caveat**: `prettyPrintOne` injects the HTML passed to it into a `<pre>` element.
   If the HTML comes from a trusted source, this may allow XSS. Do not do this.
   This should not be a problem for existing apps since the standard usage is to
   rewrite the HTML and then inject it, so anyone doing that with untrusted HTML
   already has an XSS vulnerability. If you sanitize and prettify HTML from an
   untrusted source, sanitize first.

## 4 February 2013

 * Language handlers for Dart, Erlang, Mumps, TCL, R, S., and others
 * Bug fix: VB REM style comments.
 * Bug fix: CSS color literals / ID selector confusion.
 * Bug fix: IE8 line breaks.

## 24 February 2013

 * Added a one script autoload&run mechanism and a way to embed hints in
   processing instructions/comments. See
   [example](https://rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/examples/quine.html).

## 4 March 2013

 * Matlab language handler courtesy *AmroÂ³*

## 28 Apr 2015

 * Migrated to Github
