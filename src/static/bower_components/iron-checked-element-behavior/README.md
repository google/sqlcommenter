##Polymer.IronCheckedElementBehavior

Use `Polymer.IronCheckedElementBehavior` to implement a custom element
that has a `checked` property, which can be used for validation if the
element is also `required`. Element instances implementing this behavior
will also be registered for use in an `iron-form` element.
