# Express + OpenTelemetry example app

This example Express app connects to a Cloud SQL database (Postgres or MySQL)
using Sequelize or Knex as the ORM. It is instrumented with OpenTelemetry to
collect trace data and send it to Cloud Trace. SQLCommenter attaches the
OpenTelemetry trace and span ID to the queries for correlation.

## Running

This example reads some environment variables to connect to a Cloud SQL database.

- `DBHOST` - The hostname, ip, or path to unix socket directory for Cloud SQL
database. For example, if you are using Cloud SQL proxy with a unix socket,
you might pass `/cloudsql/my-project:us-central1:my-db`
- `DBUSERNAME` - Database username
- `DBPASSWORD` - Database password
- `DBDIALECT` - Optional. Should be `postgres` (default) or `mysql`

```bash
# in this directory
$ export DBHOST="<hostname or unix socket path>"
$ export DBUSERNAME="<database user>"
$ export DBPASSWORD="<database password>"
$ export DBDIALECT="<postgres | mysql>"
$ npm install

# on first run, create some data
$ npm run createTodos

# run the sequelize server
$ npm run sequelizeServer

# in a separate terminal
$ curl http://localhost:8000
